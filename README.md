# DoodleClone

A minimal Doodle-like polling app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Data is stored in browser `localStorage` and can be deployed as a static site using GitHub Pages.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a browser to test locally. Creating a poll generates a shareable link with a unique identifier in the URL.

Use the language selector at the top of the page to switch between English and French. Your preference is saved in `localStorage`.

## Deployment

Push changes to the `main` branch. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the contents of the repository to GitHub Pages.
