# Doodle Clone Mockup

This repository contains a very simple mockup for a hypothetical Doodle Clone.
Open `index.html` in your browser to see the page.

The page now includes a **Force reload** button that will attempt to clear any
registered service worker caches and reload the page from the network. This can
be useful if an old version is still being served from the browser's cache.

## Transaction cost calculator

The page also provides a small calculator for estimating transaction costs on
different stock exchanges. Enter a trade amount, choose the exchange and click
**Compute Cost**. The following fee percentages are applied:

- New York: **0.1%**
- London: **0.5%**
- Tokyo: **0.2%**
- Frankfurt: **0.15%**
